			<h2>Margaritas and Mexican Food Date Night</h2>

			<p> We recently went on two fun margarita and Mexican food excursions, one highbrow and one lowbrow.  Both were fun and both featured bars, restraunts or food trucks we would reccommend. Fancy, or fun with a dash of DIY, both were a good time.</p>

			<p>The first was a highbrow date night that started at Maxine's Taproom for pre-dinner cocktails and moved to the Tula, the recently opend high end Mexican restraunt, for dinner and dessert.</p> 

			<p>The more affordable option was a fun Saturday afternoon picnic featuring a thermos of DIY Magragitas and a bike ride to the food truck court near Lake Fayetteville for tacos and fruit ices.

   					<td>Maxine's is pricey but worth it if you enjoy a good cocktail. They have a list of classics and a rotating menu of seasonal drinks to choose from.  We opted for a Mezcal Margarita and a Paloma to go with our theme and were pleased witht our beverages. Go early if you want a table or a seat at the bar. Happy hour at Maxine's is a chill experience but it gets louder and more crowded as the night goes on.
   					<p>Bottom line: I make a good cocktail but they make a better one. Worth it when you want to splurge.</p>
   					</td>
   					<td>I make a pretty good cocktail, and Margaritas batch nicely to put in your thermos with some ice. If you want my recipe here it is: 
   						<ul>
   							<li>1 part tequila</li>
   							<li>1 part Cointreau</li>
   							<li>1 part lime juice</li>
   						</ul>
   					<p>you can adsimple syrup to make it sweeter and scale it up to serve the number you need.</p>	
   					<p>Bottom line:cheap and cheerful. Just be discreet and be careful while drinking and biking.</p>

   					<td>Dinner at Tula<p>Tula is a new reeturant on the Fayetteville square specializing in higher end Mexican cuisine.  Its menu features items not found on your usual Tex Mex restraunt menu. It has a lovley atmosphere and is suitable for a date night without being too stuffy. 
   					Bottom line: the food and atmosphere was worth the price if you are looking for an upscale date night spot.</p><p>Bottomline:Interesting menu, quality food, nice atmosphere. do it if you want upscale.</p></td>
   					<td>Taco truck. This was a solid taco. I alwasy go for an al Pastor and while thre are better in NWA this one is good.  this was exactly what you want in a taco  for an increadible price and aAfter dessert y9ou a=can take a bike ride around Lake Fayetteville and come back for dessert. 
   					<p>Bottom Line: this is a fun experience and a solid taco selection. Cheap and Fun.</p>
